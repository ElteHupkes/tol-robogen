/**
 * Gazebo model class, derives SDF models from the functionality
 * that is currently used to place the models in the ODE world.
 * Please note that I'm taking the Model terminology from Robogen,
 * a Robogen model will *NOT* map to an SDF Model (rather an SDF
 * model will be a collection of Robogen models).
 *
 * I'll initially approach this as follows. Each Model defines several things:
 * - A set of links, with a geometry, inertia, position and
 *   orientation within the model they specify. I'll later add "visual
 *   representation" to this list.
 * - A set of joints, also with a pose / type / orientation and possibly
 *   other properties. These joints will also specify which of the links
 *   within the model they connect. I can use the handy property that there
 *   are only moving joints *within* the objects; the rest of the joints
 *   are actually fixed. So I'll never have to specify a joint to a body
 *   part in another "model".
 *
 * Fixed joints to attach models to one another will be automatically added
 * by the Robot builder.
 *
 * Ideally I'd reduce the number of links in the model by combining
 * fixed collision objects. The problem here is the inertia tensor, which
 * would then have to be applied to the combined objects.
 * I might be able to do this for fixed connections
 * within models, since I have the specifics there and could probably
 * calculate the inertia tensor with MeshLab, for instance. To do it for
 * larger chunks I'd need inertia tensors for every perceivable combination,
 * which I reckon is rather undoable.
